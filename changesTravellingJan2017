1.In Capture Thread changed the switch statement to a series of If's.
So I avoid the if defined trap on the cameras.
********************************************************************************
2.Now the only the cameras in the xml file are detected.
The camera defines in the Config.h are now obsolete.
********************************************************************************
3.Tidied up the camera detection loops in CameraContainer.cpp and tested - working well.
Detecting all 4 Basler Cameras and 2 TDalsa cams.
********************************************************************************
NOTE/OBSERVATION
When running the program with the line scan cameras but no drum motion. When grabbing is called (with no drum motion no image)
the cameras cannot be closed when mainwindow exit is called.
SUGGESTION: So we need a time out on no line detection. TODO!!!!!!!
********************************************************************************
4.Now we have changed the order of the destructors.
So that we destroy the cameraWidgets, then the cameraContainer then the mainwindow. This is the correct order of things.
NOT tested with SISO and TD cameras
********************************************************************************
5.Put the Pylon::InstantCamera stopGrabbing() in the CaptureThread Release() to elegently stop the camera grabbing images when we
close the program down.
********************************************************************************
6. In the TeledynedalsaSapera::release()function we have put the freeze() and wait(5000) functions to stop grabbing before exit.
Also in the destructor we have put the Sapera resource destruction.
Note: for some reason including the delete AcqDevice line cause the program to hang when closing down. So commented out for the
time being.
