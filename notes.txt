These should go in the mainwindow holding the container widget

//    QScrollArea* scrollArea;
//    scrollArea = new QScrollArea;
//    scrollArea->setWidget(logoLabel);


Connect to camera HOW??????????????

CameraWidget should have a pointer to SharedImageBuffer in its Constructor??????????

/*Writing to file

cv::FileStorage storage("test.yml", cv::FileStorage::WRITE);
storage << "img" << img;

Reading from file

cv::FileStorage storage("test.yml", cv::FileStorage::READ);

storage.release();

Standard for new class

in the header
class DefectImageStorage : public QWidget
{
    Q_OBJECT

public:
    explicit DefectImageStorage(QWidget *parent, int numberOfImages);
    ~DefectImageStorage();

in the implementation (.cpp)
DefectImageStorage::DefectImageStorage(QWidget *parent, int numberOfImages) : QWidget(parent), queueLength(numberOfImages) etc

StopMotion Class - responsible for contolling the stopping logic of the inspection machine.
Name CstopMotion
CHS 2OCT2016

Data Members

Private:
1. Stopping Offest in number of Frames(from camera to repair/mark station).
Type and name:int mStopOffset

2. OnStopBeforeStartReverse in number of Frames.
Type and name:int mOnStopBeforeStartReverse
Description:
If the machine stops there will be some sub optimal frames during the machines
deceleration and on start subsequent acceleration.This could lead to a portion of uninspected fabric. It would be desirable to run
the fabric in reverse to a position such that when we run the fabric (forward) again. We pick up optimum inspection at the position
when the previous stop was invoked. (This has implications for the frame reference in the database - so needs careful design).

3. StopMotionOn
Type and name:bool mStopMotionOn.

4.Reversing Mechanism on
Type and name:bool mReverseOnDefect.
Description: Enable the reversing Mechanism.


NOTE: What happens when there are defects in the web in the frames closely subsequent to the first defect (also from mutiple Cameras)- we do not want to start stop start stop etc OR DO WE???
